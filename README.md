            To interact with challenge 1:
                        - Navigate to line 33 and replace the gradeCalculator value (70) with the desired mark you would like to get the grade for i.e. 
                                    
                                                In the equation:
                                                
                                                let result = gradeCalculator (70, 100)

            To interact with challenge 2:
                        - Navigate to line 74 and replace the speedDetector value (80) with a value of your choosing to assess license status i.e.

                                                console.log(speedDetector (80));
                                                
            To interact with challenge 3:
